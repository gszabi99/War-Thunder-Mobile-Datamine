Creates and returns a new debounced version of the passed function which will postpone its execution until
after wait milliseconds have elapsed since the last time it was invoked.
when delay_s_max is not a null, real delay will become random value between delay_s and delay_s_max

Useful for implementing behavior that should only happen after the input has stopped arriving.
For example: rendering a preview of a Markdown comment, recalculating a layout after the window has stopped being resized, and so on.
